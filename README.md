## ðŸ”” News

ðŸŽŠ We plan to integrate [Grounded-Segment-Anything](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything), [Yolo-World](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World), and [OWLv2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/owlv2) into this mapping pipeline, for **online open-world semantic-mapping**.
Additionally, we will support [Habitat-Lab](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab) to advance developments in embodied-AI. Stay tuned for our upcoming feature releases and donâ€™t forget to give us a star!

ðŸ”¥ **27/12/2024** Release experiment configs and launch files.

ðŸ”¥ **26/11/2024** Release main algorithms!

ðŸ¤— **15/10/2024** Presented at [iros2024-abudhabi](https://iros2024-abudhabi.org/)

ðŸš€ **30/06/2024** Accepted by IROS2024!

ðŸ“œ **26/03/2024** arXiv version [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16880)

## ðŸŽˆ Getting Started

### Step1: Dataset and Pre-process
**SemanticKITTI**: Prepare the dataset to desired format, following [dataset](panoptic_mapping_utils/src/kitti_dataset/README.md).

**flat**: Download the dataset from the [ASL Datasets](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=panoptic_mapping).

### Step2 Workspace setup
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-wstool
mkdir -p DHP_ws/src
cd DHP_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:hutslib/DHP-mapping.git
wstool init . ./DHP-mapping/panoptic_mapping_ssh.rosinstall    # SSH
cd ..
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/noetic
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
catkin config --merge-devel
catkin build panoptic_mapping_utils
source ../devel/setup.zsh
```

### Step3 Modify config and launch file to run an experiment
The launch files are located in:
[panoptic_mapping_ros/launch/iros_exp](panoptic_mapping_ros/launch/iros_exp)

The config files are located in:
[panoptic_mapping_ros/config/mapper/iros_exp](panoptic_mapping_ros/config/mapper/iros_exp)

### Key Modifications:
- Update `base_path` and `config` in the launch file.
- Note: For long sequences in SemanticKITTI, adjust `max_frames` in the launch file to limit the number of frames based on your device's memory.
- Update the following in the config file:
  - `save_map_path_when_finished`
  - `label_info_print_path`
  - `save_mesh_folder_path`
  - `submap_info_path`
  - `Tr`
  - `P2`
  - `labels: file_name`
  - `visualization: colormap_print_path`
- Note: The `Tr` and `P2` parameters should be modified based on the extrinsics calculated in the [data preprocess step](panoptic_mapping_utils/src/kitti_dataset/README.md#-ðŸ“Œ-data-process).

```bash
# run the experiment
roslaunch panoptic_mapping_ros iros_exp_kitti_detectron_07.launch
```
